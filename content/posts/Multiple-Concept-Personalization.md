# Multiple Concept Personalization

Diffusion Model 在產生一般圖片時已經很強了，但想要用 Diffusion models 來客製化自己多個想要的照片或圖片是一個目前還沒解決的問題，譬如說我想要產生我家狗狗跟貓貓去日本泡溫泉的照片，。
## Current Challenges

### Concept Bleeding and Interference

One of the primary challenges in multi-concept generation is "**concept bleeding**" where different concepts unintentionally merge or interfere with each other, leading to inaccurate representations in generated images. This issue arises due to the overlapping or merging of various concepts during the synthesis process.像是這個 [[Multi-Concept Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion|Custom Diffusion]] 的例子，狗狗貓貓融合了變成狗貓狗貓，原因應該是在於兩個 latent feature 很接近的時候，兩者的邊界會變得模糊，diffusion model幾乎分辨不出來兩者的差別，所以產出來的圖片就像是混合種。

### Customization and Concept Conflicts

Customizing diffusion models to support multiple concepts simultaneously can lead to conflicts, such as **identity loss and concept conflicts**, especially when using decentralized approaches like low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) . Additionally, the scarcity of user-provided examples for customized concepts exacerbates visual confusion .

### Performance and Erasure Issues

Existing methods for erasing unsafe concepts from models often compromise generative performance and fail to address the coupling among multi-concept erasures, leading to challenges in concept restoration .

## Recent Implementations and Solutions

### Decentralized Customization and Fusion

The [[Mix-of-Show - Decentralized Low-Rank Adaptation for Multi-Concept Customization of Diffusion Models|Mix-of-Show]] framework addresses decentralized multi-concept customization by using **embedding-decomposed LoRA** for single-client tuning and gradient fusion to preserve the essence of individual concepts. This approach supports limitless concept fusion and introduces regionally controllable sampling to tackle attribute binding issues .

### Isolated Diffusion and Concept Isolation

The Isolated Diffusion approach proposes isolating the synthesis processes of different concepts to prevent mutual interference. This method uses split text prompts and pre-trained object detection models to isolate and resynthesize subjects individually, effectively addressing concept bleeding without additional training .

### Concept Neurons and Efficient Storage

The Cones method identifies clusters of neurons, termed concept neurons, that correspond to specific subjects. This approach allows for efficient manipulation and generation of multiple concepts by storing sparse clusters of neuron indices, significantly reducing storage requirements .

## Generative Data Pipelines and Metrics

Gen4Gen introduces a semi-automated dataset creation pipeline to improve multi-concept personalization. It also proposes comprehensive metrics (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) to evaluate the presence and accuracy of multiple concepts in generated images, enhancing the quality of multi-concept image generation .

## Conclusion

The field of multi-concept generation in diffusion models is rapidly evolving, with significant strides being made to address challenges like concept bleeding and customization conflicts. Recent frameworks and methodologies, such as Mix-of-Show, Isolated Diffusion, and Cones, offer promising solutions by focusing on decentralized customization, concept isolation, and efficient storage. These advancements not only improve the fidelity and accuracy of multi-concept generation but also pave the way for more robust and versatile applications of diffusion models in generative AI.
